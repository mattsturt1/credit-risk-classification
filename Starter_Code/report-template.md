## Overview of the Analysis

The goal of this project is to see whether or not potential borrowers are fit to borrow. the data here is gathered with historical and lending datasets from a variety of lending services. Using  a Logistic Regression model, the model takes a closer look at identifying patterns and make predictons
## Results

Machine Learning Model (0)

Accuracy: 99%
Precision: 100%
Recall: 99%
Machine Learning Model (1): 

Accuracy: 99%
Precision: 85%
Recall: 91%

## Summary

Summarize the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. For example:

They both seem reasonable to be trusted. while one is greater is in its ability (0), I would think that boht of these models are fit to do the job. some financial institutions wish to take slightly riskier loans in order to drive up funds.
